                <h1>About Izzaty Balqis.</h1>
                <p class="about-text">
                    I'm an undergraduate student currently in my second year, pursuing a degree in Graphics and Multimedia Software at Universiti Teknologi Malaysia. I was born and raised in Johor, 
                    growing up in a peaceful countryside environment that shaped much of who I am today. Initially, I was drawn to mathematics and statistics during my school years, enjoying the logic and problem-solving aspects. 
                    However, during matriculation, my interests began to shift as I was introduced to the world of programming. Although it was unfamiliar and challenging at first, I soon discovered the adventurous and rewarding nature of learning how to code. 
                    The process of creating something from scratch through logic and creativity fascinated me, and it quickly became a new passion. Since then, I’ve been eager to expand my skills, explore different programming languages, and develop software that combines both functionality and visual appeal—perfectly aligning with my current field of study.
                </p>
                <h1>Hobbies.</h1> 
                <p class="about-text">
                    One of my favorite hobbies is drawing—it's a part of my daily life. Whether I'm stressed, bored, or just need a break, I find comfort in expressing myself through art. Although I'm not a professional artist, 
                    I believe I have a creative spark that shows in my work. Sometimes, I do feel a little envious of other talented artists, but that feeling actually motivates me to keep improving, creating, and growing in the world of art.
                    This is one of my art where i upload it on <a class="about-link" href="https://www.deviantart.com/zty98">deviantArt</a>
                </p> 
                <p class="about-text">
                    Besides drawing, gaming is another hobby that plays a big role in my life, like Genshin Impact and Mobile Legends. While some people may see gaming as a waste of time, I believe it has valuable benefits, especially when played with friends. 
                    It teaches teamwork, communication, and adaptability—skills that are useful not just in games, but also in real-life situations, including the workplace.
